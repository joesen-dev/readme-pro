## Installation

You will need Node.js to run the application. You can find a guide on installation [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

**Step 1**

> Clone the repository to your local machine.

**Step 2**

> cd to the directory with your cloned repo. In this case, you'll want to be in the "Develop" directory.

**Step 3**
The repo comes with a package.json with the required dependencies to type the following command into your CLI

> `npm install`

> `npm install`

Now youâ€™re ready to start generating your README.

## Usage

##### To run the application, type enter <sub>_node \<filename\>_</sub> into your command prompt.

**Use case example**

> `node index.js`

The app will give you a series of prompts to answer. Some are required, while others are optional. The app prompts you to open a notepad for your answers for some sections. Data entered in the notepad should be formatted in the markdown language, as this will be rendered accordingly in your readme at the end.

Save and close the notepad once you've entered the requested data.

Once you've answered all the questions, your README file is auto-generated.
